[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have decided to develop a LAN party application that helps organize and run events. 
It will be able to keep track of attendance helping with check ins and raffle drawings based on who is still present. 
Also i will add challonge's API to allow tournament info to be visible and accessible for those participating. Also add a forum or chat 
section for players to communicate and start games. This software will especially help event organizers run a smoother event 
and give them quick visual data on whats currently happening.
### Features
User login: Each user will be able to register allowing for them to create a profile 

Challonge API: implement this into the site to allow users to sign up for and update their tournament information

Forum/message board: place for event organizers and attendees to communicate and cordinate games.

Attendance Manager: system for keeping track of per person check in and possibly a seating chart for visual on who is present 
and where they're seated.
