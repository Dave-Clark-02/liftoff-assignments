## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is meant to be a home renovation budget estimator. We hope to create a site that people can create profiles, enter detailed item lists, and compare their renovations to others. Currently doing a search online will get you an average cost estimate that in my experience tends to be high and somewhat vague.
This project aims to provide more in depth information and ways to cross compare that data to allow for a more accurate estimate. Once registered users can quickly search to find other renovations on similarly aged homes and see what materials were purchased.
### Features
User login, user profile, search feature for comparing renovations, posting new renovations to user profile, map search for homes near my location that had similar renovations.
posting progress pictures to user profile, user able to select items from drop down list to populate a itemized material list that was used on renovation.
### Technologies
Java, JavaScript, maybe angular or react, thymeleaf, gradle, spring boot
### What I'll Have to Learn
how to connect a front end created in javascript to a backend made in Java. How to pull data to populate project.
